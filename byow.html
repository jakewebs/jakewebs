        <p>
            This project was done in my Data Structures & Algorithms class with a partner to apply
            our work in the class. Together, we made a world generation algorithm that would generate
            rooms of random sizes at random locations, and connected this with an intelligent hallway
            algorithm that opened doors to connect all the rooms. On the other hand, players could choose
            to create their own worlds with our Build option. Notably, the world generation algorithm is
            pseudorandom, so using the same seed twice would yield the same world.
        </p>

        <p>
            With this world generated, we then chose random locations for the player, items, enemies, and
            even the world theme. Then, players would have to try and collect the Crown to gain the ability
            to vanquish the clever enemies, which prior to that powerup would chase the player to try and
            take away their lives (much like PAC-MAN). When the player either reached zero lives or defeated all the enemies,
            the game would be over. Additionally, players can save the game, quit, and load the game once
            again to keep playing from the same point.

    <h2 class = "header">My Contributions</h2>
    <div class = "text">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wrote an A* algorithm that was used by enemies to find the shortest path to
                the player, thus making the game action-packed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Worked on the hallway generation algorithm, which used a QuickUnion to make sure
                all of the rooms were connected and kept working until they were.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented many of the key game mechanics, from lives to powerups to player movements.

        <p>
            Because this was a class project, I am not allowed to make this code publicly
            accessible- part of which means I cannot upload it to the Github repo to allow
            interactivity on this site. However, I have been given permission to privately
            share it with interested parties outside of my university, so do contact me if
            you are curious and would like to give it a try!
